### Estimating the Number of Zero-Sum Triples

We want to estimate the expected number of **triples** (sets of three numbers) that sum to zero, given \( n \) random
integers uniformly chosen from the range \( [-m, m] \), where \( m \) is large.

#### Step 1: Probability of a Zero-Sum Triple

A **triple** is a set of three integers \( (x_i, x_j, x_k) \) such that:

\[
x_i + x_j + x_k = 0
\]

for distinct indices \( i, j, k \).

Since numbers are chosen uniformly from \( [-m, m] \), the total number of possible values is:

\[
2m + 1
\]

For two randomly chosen numbers \( x_i \) and \( x_j \), the third number is uniquely determined as \( x_k = -(x_i +
x_j) \). The probability that \( x_k \) exists in the set is approximately:

\[
\frac{1}{2m + 1}
\]

#### Step 2: Counting Possible Triples

The number of ways to choose three distinct elements from \( n \) elements is:

\[
\binom{n}{3} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}
\]

Since each triple has a probability of approximately \( \frac{1}{2m+1} \) of summing to zero, the expected number of
zero-sum triples is:

\[
E(T) \approx \binom{n}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2m+1}
\]

#### Step 3: Approximation for Large \( n \) and \( m \)

For large \( n \), we approximate:

\[
n(n-1)(n-2) \approx n^3
\]

So, the expected number of zero-sum triples simplifies to:

\[
E(T) \approx \frac{n^3}{12m}
\]

### Conclusion

The number of zero-sum triples follows the model:

\[
E(T) \approx \frac{n^3}{12m}
\]

This means:

- The number of zero-sum triples grows **cubically** with \( n \).
- The number of zero-sum triples **inversely** depends on \( m \), meaning that for a large range, zero-sum triples
  become rarer.
